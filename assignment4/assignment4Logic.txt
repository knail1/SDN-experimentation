To access tcp part of the packet, you shall use find method:

tcpp = packet.find("tcp").dstport


A hint is to call the instal_fwdrule to install forwarding rules if the packet comes from a dedicated switch in a dedicated port. Some steps may be:

1. Create a tuple with fields: dpid, MAC source, MAC dest, tcp's port
2. Check if it matches to any index in self.portmap
3. If yes, get the next dpid from the self.portmap. Then install forwarding rules from current dpid to next dpid
